## In/Finite (2023)

In collaboration with Luca Spanedda, a sound installation modelling the behaviour of organic matter turning into compost. Commissioned by the Waste Compost Radio project.

## Machine Milieu (2013 - present)

Live performance duo with Agostino Di Scipio exploring interactions between our independently developed autonomous systems and relational performance modalities.

## Acoustic Shadows (2020)

In collaboration with Paul Gruendorfer, a sound installation exploring complex adaptive systems within networks of highly directional acoustic streams where the topologies are affected by the physical presence of the audience. The work was funded by the City of Vienna.

## Constructing Realities (2019 - 2020)

Autonomous music via complex adaptive systems with an information processing infrastructure following radical constructivist paradigms.

## Order from Noise (2016 - 2019)

Performance project with an autonomous music system of morphing positive-negative feedback relationships where global formal developments are given by the divergence of different initial conditions.

## Inexorable Shifting 2 (2019)

Autonomous music exploring audio feedback networks with self-regulating frequency shifting processing.

## Phase Transitions (2019)

Long-form (about three months) piece exploring digital deterioration and observer-related perception of musical complexity. This work was commissioned by the Rotting Sounds project.

## Single-Fader Versatility (2013 - 2019)

Performance environment exploring cybernetics principles for one-to-many mapping strategies and human-machine interfacing.

## Human Network: Machine Nostalgia (2016 - 2018)

An instrumental piece exploring a relational score to implement feedback networks of human agents.
