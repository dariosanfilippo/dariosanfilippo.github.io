<p>My friend Andrea Arcella is curating a lecture at Naples&rsquo; University L'Orientale on &ldquo;Questions Concerning Rhythm in Electro-Acoustic Music&rdquo;. Me, Andrea and Salvatore Carannante will discuss some points, and namely I will talk about Emergent Rhythm Phenomena with examples from my project, my collaboration with Andrea Valle and other works by Agostino Di Scipio and Toshimaru Nakamura.</p>
