<p>These days I have implemented a kind of nonlinear distortion for a feedback system where the transfer function is the output signal itself. Thus we have feedback in the audio domain, as the output feeds back into the input through microphones, as well as in the control domain, as the shaping function is cyclicly updated with the transfered signal. Some highly dynamical and interesting results have been achieved, and this, together with some other minor modifications in the patches led to the 1.1 version of the LIES (distance/incidence) work, which will be performed at Ferro3, Scafati (SA) next Sat, along with a solo by Chris Galarreta and then our duo improvisation.Â </p>
