<a href="https://github.com/dariosanfilippo/pd-externals/tree/master/blit~">dariosanfilippo/pd-externals</a><br/><p>First and last PD external of 2017: a band-limited impulse train which can be used to generate nicely sounding band-limited oscillators and modulations.</p><p>Based on [Stilson and Smith 1996]:Â <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~stilti/papers/blit.pdf" target="_blank">https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~stilti/papers/blit.pdf</a>.</p><p>Inlets are signal-only. Respectively: pulse frequency (Hz), number of harmonics (limited to the maximum allowed at that frequency), bipolar/unipolar output (&lt; 0/&gt;= 0).</p><p>The harmonic content variation is phase-locked to avoid discontinuities, so there is a delay &lt;= to the pulse period before those variations take place. (Very tiny in most cases.)</p><p>Happy new year!</p>
