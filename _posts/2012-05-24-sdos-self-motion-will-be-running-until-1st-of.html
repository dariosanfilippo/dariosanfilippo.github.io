<p>Description:</p>
<p>circular feedback network with two interacting loops, one with piezo and monitors, the other with mics and monitors. Both loops have the longest paths, i.e. in1-out2-in2-out3-in3-out1-in1, resulting in longer feedback delays, thus smoother dynamics. The loop with piezo operates at the minimum possible, while the loop with mics is just below feedback. Piezos, placed on the woofer, will produce sounds which will move themselves, and sound will be in turn affected. The changing sounds can either trigger or suppress the Larsen, while Larsen can dampen, suppress or reinforce the piezos, creating a contrast/support relationship between the two loops.</p>
