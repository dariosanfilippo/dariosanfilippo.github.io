<p>It&rsquo;s been a year now since I started my master&rsquo;s degree in electronic music with Agostino Di Scipio at the Conservatory of Naples. I&rsquo;m so happy for both the city I&rsquo;m living in and the things I&rsquo;m studying. Agostino, as I had no doubt even before starting this course, is an amazing theorist/composer/sound artist, and also a great teacher I can now say. In this year I&rsquo;ve learnt so many interesting and inspiring things, and our classes are always fruitful discussions to better know other&rsquo;s and one&rsquo;s self work. Moreover, I was lucky enough to share the house with my friend Fabrizio, and to know other people who became my friends with which very nice music collaborations are developing.</p>
