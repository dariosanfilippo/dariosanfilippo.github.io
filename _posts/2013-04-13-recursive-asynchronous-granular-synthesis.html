<p>These days I&rsquo;ve been working on something I first proposed a year ago for an exam at the conservatory. It&rsquo;s about achieving asynchronous granular synthesis by means of recursive processes, instead of random/stochastic ones. Consider a basic design for a granulator. You have a pointer going through the indexing of a buffer, and readers playing back grains from the area of the buffer indexed by the pointer. Some of the parameters you can work with are the grain window (spectral spread), pointer&rsquo;s speed (time stretching), readers&rsquo; speed (pitch shifting), and the time interval between grains (horizontal and vertical density, if overlap takes place). In my implementation, I have experimented by mapping such parameters to the characteristics of the output sound itself, thus creating a control feedback. Namely, in my first tests I have injected perturbation by mapping the RMS output over the index of the buffer, and adding that value to the current readers&rsquo; position each time a grain is played back. It is interesting because it is possible to establish different relations between sound and perturbation, thus realising positive and/or negative feedback. For example, if the RMS is proportional to the readers&rsquo; position shift, the greater the RMS, the greater the shift, resulting in a behaviour where the louder the sound is, the more the next grains will be &ldquo;escaping&rdquo; from the loud area of the buffer and eventually focus in areas with less intensity. Of course the other parameters can be mapped in a similar way, and it is also possible to use other characteristics of the sound related to the parameters of the granulator: centroid-pitch shift; RMS-interval between grains; spectral noisiness-grain size; etc&hellip;</p>
