Unlike the LIES (inner variables) performance where the possible behaviours ofÂ the system are explored by modifying the internal system variables, in this new approach the behaviours are explored using microphones. Namely, the system has fixed internal variables and is configured so that different sound generators (negative feedback sub-networks with coefficients &lt; 1, thus where no self-oscillation takes place) operate when positive acoustic feedback (Larsen) is established and have different sensitivities to the intensity and components of sound. This way the system is explored by the performer who moves in the environment and varies the distance between microphones and loudspeakers and the angle of incidence of sound.</p>
